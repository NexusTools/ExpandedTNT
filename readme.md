ExpandedTNT
========================
__ExpandedTNT__ is a **Minecraft Mod** of which simply adds a method to craft 'dynamic' TNT.

Basically the fundamentals of this mod is that it adds a new crafting table called "TNT Crafting Table" of which allows you to dynamically make new variants of TNT that launches whatever item you see fit.

So, for example you could have it so your newly crafted TNT has 1 single item-stack of tnt on the left side, and another stack of arrows to the right, and when it's rendered it'd have those item stacks rendered into the model aswell. Once launched it'll also launch entities of the apporiate items you've placed alongside the TNT.

TODO:
=============
* Actually create the new TNT variant, currently the implementation exists, just doesn't actually have any functionality. The plan is to dynamically use metadata to store the ones that currently exist.
