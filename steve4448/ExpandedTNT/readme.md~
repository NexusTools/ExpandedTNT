ExpandedTNT
========================
__ExpandedTNT__ is a **Minecraft Mod** which simply adds new types of TNT, totally original. Each custom TNT explodes in a (I believe) 1x1x1 area to set-off any close-by TNT.

Currently the following new TNT's exist, and via configuration files are possible to disable/enable:

* Arrow TNT - Launches arrows in a rather sphereical pattern.
* Egg TNT - Eggs everywhere.
* TNT TNT - Launches regular TNT.
* TNT TNT TNT - Launches TNT TNT, of which will launch regular TNT, rather absurd.

TODO:
=============
* Customization of how many entities are launched by each block.
* Possibly make it more dynamic in how they are added to the point where it's potentially exponential in TNT variants.
